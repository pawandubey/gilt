# gilt (WIP)

A lazy tool for lazy people. Runs a given command across all your local git repositories.

> **âš  Still a work in progress! Use at your own peril.**

## What

This is a simple tool that does a very simple thing: it takes a command and runs it in each git repository under a directory you point it to (default: `$HOME`). It then collates the result and prints them out per repository. That's it.

In addition, it has some quality-of-life options:
- [] (WIP) Colorize (slightly) the default output.
- [] (WIP) Output the result as JSON in case you want to pipe it into another program like `jq`.

## How

```bash
gilt --colorize --location /path/to/parent/dir --exec "git status -s" --output json
```

## Why

This started as a Ruby script that identified all unsynced branches across all local git repositories. Of course, I was not happy with such a specific solution, so had to go ahead and make something more generic so that I can never use it again.

## Why "gilt"?

Because "global git" and it's better than "glit", which was what I started with. I believe in quitting while you're ahead.
